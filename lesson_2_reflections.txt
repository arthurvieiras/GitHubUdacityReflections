1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    You start to watch for modifications in that directory and you start having the
    capability to make save-points (commits). You need to do it because without it
    you can't make your versioning.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    It differs from both working directory and repository because you can put and
    remove files from there without removing them physically from your directory.
    Therefore if there is a change in your repository but you feel like it shouldn't
    be committed at that time, you simply don't push it to the staging area.
