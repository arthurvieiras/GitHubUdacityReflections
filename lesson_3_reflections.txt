1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    Specially when I need to work in the same project at diferent places (computers) or when there is someone else working along.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Specially because there is no need for pushing things so frequently as git manages to make versions for you even offline. And as anyone can push to a remote pushing all the time may cause conflicts all the time too, and one would loose more time resolving conflicts than coding.
